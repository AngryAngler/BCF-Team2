PAN-SA-2016-0014 - XSS Vulnerability - Exploitation of this problem is available only to interactive users logged in to the management interface with read and write privileges

Mitigation: This issue is available only to web interface authenticated users. Palo Alto Networks recommends implementing best practices, only allowing management access to a restricted set of IP addresses, and dedicating management of the device to the management interface only.

PAN-SA-2017-0027 - Vuln in PAN-OS and Panorama on Mgmt interface

Mitigation: Palo Alto Networks has released content update 756 including vulnerability signatures #40483 and #40484 that can be used as an interim mitigation to protect PAN-OS devices until the device software is upgraded. Note that signatures 40483 and 40484 must be applied to a firewall rule securing traffic destined for the Management interface. This issue affects the management interface of the device and is strongly mitigated by following best practices for the isolation of management interfaces for security appliances. We recommend that the management interface be isolated and strictly limited only to security administration personnel through either network segmentation or using the IP access control list restriction feature within PAN-OS. An alternative mitigation includes the use of a Panorama central manager and disabling of http and https management on each of the vulnerable appliance, then use the Panorama context switching feature to remotely access the web interface of the device.
